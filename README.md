ubuntu-auto-installer
=====================

Requirements:
* Ubuntu (preferabbly latest version)
* Git preinstalled

This is a script meant to ask you and install common applications including some processes of changing configurations files. I keep on doing it for each Ubuntu installation that I do, so I figured I might as well make a script to do it for me.

Packages this installs:
* VIM
* Filezilla
* VLC
* Gimp
* Ubuntu Restricted Extras
* Google Chrome
* Skype
* Netflix
* Spotify
* Heroes of Newerth
 
Scripts that this runs:
* Removes the amazon and other online search lenses from the unity dashboard
* Disables Ubuntu's annoying error messages that pop up WAY too often
* Runs the SPF13 script for installing an awesome vim configuration

If you have any suggestions for additions to the script, please let me know. Feel free to fork this and create your own version. It is very simple to edit.
